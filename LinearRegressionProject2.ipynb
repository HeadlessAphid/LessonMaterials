    "Simple Linear Regression (or SLR) is the simplest model in machine learning. It models the linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, there is one independent or input variable which represents the Sales data and is denoted by X. Similarly, there is one dependent or output variable which represents the Advertising data and is denoted by y. We want to build a linear relationship between these variables. This linear relationship can be modelled by mathematical equation of the form:-\n",
    "\t\t\t\t \n",
    "                 \n",
    "                 Y = β0   + β1*X    -------------   (1)\n",
    "                 \n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, X and Y are called independent and dependent variables respectively,\n",
    "\n",
    "β1 is the coefficient for independent variable and\n",
    "\n",
    "β0 is the constant term.\n",
    "\n",
    "β0 and β1 are called parameters of the model.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we can compare the above equation with the basic line equation of the form:-\n",
    " \n",
    "                   y = ax + b       ----------------- (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that \n",
    "\n",
    "slope of the line is given by, a =  β1,  and\n",
    "\n",
    "intercept of the line by b =  β0. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Simple Linear Regression model, we want to fit a line which estimates the linear relationship between X and Y. So, the question of fitting reduces to estimating the parameters of the model β0 and β1. \n",

    "## Ordinary Least Square Method\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, our task is to find a line which best fits this scatter plot. This line will help us to predict the value of any Target variable for any given Feature variable. This line is called **Regression line**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define an error function for any line. Then, the regression line is the one which minimizes the error function. Such an error function is also called a **Cost function**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cost Function\n",
    "\n",
    "We want the Regression line to resemble the dataset as closely as possible. In other words, we want the line to be as close to actual data points as possible. It can be achieved by minimizing the vertical distance between the actual data point and fitted line. I calculate the vertical distance between each data point and the line. This distance is called the **residual**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in a regression model, we try to minimize the residuals by finding the line of best fit. The residuals are represented by the vertical dotted lines from actual data points to the line.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "We can try to minimize the sum of the residuals, but then a large positive residual would cancel out a large negative residual. For this reason, we minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we denote actual data points by yi and predicted data points by ŷi. So, the residual for a data point i would be given as \n",

    "                di = yi -  ŷi\n",
    "\n",

    "                \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **Cost function**. It denotes the total error present in the model which is the sum of the total errors of each individual data point. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can estimate the parameters of the model β0 and β1 by minimize the error in the model by minimizing D. Thus, we can find the regression line given by equation (1).\n",

    "The RMSE value has been found to be 11.2273. It means the standard deviation for our prediction is 11.2273. So, sometimes we expect the predictions to be off by more than 11.2273 and other times we expect less than 11.2273. So, the model is not good fit to the data. \n",

    "In business decisions, the benchmark for the R2 score value is 0.7. It means if R2 score value >= 0.7, then the model is good enough to deploy on unseen data whereas if R2 score value < 0.7, then the model is not good enough to deploy. Our R2 score value has been found to be .5789. It means that this model explains 57.89 % of the variance in our dependent variable. So, the R2 score value confirms that the model is not good enough to deploy because it does not provide good fit to the data.\n"

    "\n",

    "The Linear Regression Model is based on several assumptions which are listed below:-\n",
    "\n",
    "i.\tLinear relationship\n",
    "ii.\tMultivariate normality\n",
    "iii.\tNo or little multicollinearity\n",
    "iv.\tNo auto-correlation\n",
    "v.\tHomoscedasticity\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### i.\tLinear relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between response and feature variables should be linear. This linear relationship assumption can be tested by plotting a scatter-plot between response and feature variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ii.\tMultivariate normality\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear regression model requires all variables to be multivariate normal. A multivariate normal distribution means a vector in multiple normally distributed variables, where any linear combination of the variables is also normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### iii.\tNo or little multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that there is little or no multicollinearity in the data. Multicollinearity occurs when the features (or independent variables) are highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### iv.\tNo auto-correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is assumed that there is little or no auto-correlation in the data. Autocorrelation occurs when the residual errors are not independent from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### v.\tHomoscedasticity\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity describes a situation in which the error term (that is, the noise in the model) is the same across all values of the independent variables. It means the residuals are same across the regression line. It can be checked by looking at scatter plot.\n"
